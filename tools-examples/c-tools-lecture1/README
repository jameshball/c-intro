C Tools Lecture 1 Materials

- to prepare, in this directory
	make mkdir

- see what that has created by:
	find ~/c-tools

- then edit your ~/.bashrc and add, at the bottom:

export TOOLDIR=$HOME/c-tools
export PATH="$TOOLDIR/bin:$TOOLDIR/bin/$ARCH:$PATH"
export MANPATH=${MANPATH}:$TOOLDIR/man

  then run it (. ~/.bashrc)

Then sequence through the following directories,
following the instructions in each directory's README.

- 01.intlist
	- this is the make example
	- details in 01.intlist's README,
	  explore it as much as you like.

- 02.c-mfbuild
	- for those interested, here's my first attempt at building
	  a tool to build Makefiles for simple C projects, written
	  in C, dating to the late 1990s, called mfbuild.

- 03.perl-mbuild
	- for those interested, here's my second attempt at building
	  a tool to build Makefiles for simple C projects,
	  dating to 2016, written in Perl this time, also called mfbuild.

- 04.intlist-with-lib
	- this is the 01.intlist example, split into a separate library
	  directory called lib (containing the intlist module and it's
	  test program), and the top level directory (containing the
	  avgwordlen main program and a Makefile to build the library,
	  include it and link to it.

- 05.libintlist
	- here, the list-of-integers module (intlist.c and intlist.h) and
	  it's test program (testlist.c) are entirely separated from
	  applications (eg. the avgwordlen program) that USE intlists.
	- now, the Makefile has a new "install" target, to install the library
	  in the TOOLDIR/lib/ARCH directory, and intlist.h into TOOLDIR/include.
	- once you've gone into this directory and run "make install", your
	  TOOLDIR library permanently contains the intlist ADT, for us to
	  reuse in other apps whenever we like.

- 06.avgwordlen-only
	- this contains the real application program (avgwordlen.c) that uses
	  intlists from the c-tools library, and a Makefile that tells the C
	  compiler to look in the library both for includes and libraries,
	  and specifically to link in -lintlist.
	- 05.libintlist and 06.avgwordlen-only show how to typically do full
	  separation: your TOOLDIR library permanently contains the intlist
	  ADT, for us to reuse in other apps whenever we like.

- 07.intlist-with-cmake
	- a version of 04.intlist-with-lib using CMake to generate the
	  Makefiles for us.  The source code is IDENTICAL to
	  04.intlist-with-lib, the Makefiles have been replaced with
	  CMakeLists.txt files (and the README has been modified to
	  explain it).
